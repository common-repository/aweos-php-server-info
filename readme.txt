Brief dashboard overview. Use this plugin to get all important server and PHP information. Useful tool for developer that need information about their system in general, post, pages and much more.

== Description ==
### Server information for WordPress sites
AWEOS PHP Server Info is used to get a quick overview of important server configurations. A widget is displayed right at your admin dashboard.

We made this tool to encourage webmasters to update their sites to the newest PHP versions and check their configuration. Additionally, you get a glance at your server's configuration like the "Memory Limit" and "Max Execution Time" which can point you in the right direction if something's wrong with your site.

#### We provide you with information about:

- Operating System.
- PHP Version.
- Memory Limit.
- Max Execution Time.
- Upload Max Filesize.
- Blog Post Counter (Not trashed posts)
- All Pages Counter.
- Product Counter (For Woo Commerce)
- Published Pages Counter.
